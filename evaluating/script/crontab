  1 # Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
  2 #
  3 # Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
  4 # indicating with different fields when the task will be run
  5 # and what command to run for the task
  6 #
  7 # To define the time you can provide concrete values for
  8 # minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
  9 # and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
 10 #
 11 # Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
 12 # daemon's notion of time and timezones.
 13 #
 14 # Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
 15 # email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
 16 #
 17 # For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
 18 # at 5 a.m every week with:
 19 # 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
 20 #
